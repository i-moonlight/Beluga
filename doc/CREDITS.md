## Credits

The BelugaProjet was developed by [RexKramer1](https://github.com/RexKramer1) and [amnesica](https://github.com/amnesica/). It uses parts and a lot of the concepts of the [tar1090](https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090) repository by [wiedehopf](https://github.com/wiedehopf) and of [dump1090](https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090) by [flightaware](https://github.com/flightaware). Maybe there are far more contributors. Please tell us if we have forgotten someone. Ein ganz großes Dankeschön / a lot of thanks to all of you.
